 ## Project Description :page_facing_up: 
 
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. ... After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 25 minutes.
